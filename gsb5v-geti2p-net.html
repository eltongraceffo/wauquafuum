All communications over I2P network are anonymous and end-to-end encrypted, participants don't reveal their real IP addresses. The new transport protocol NTCP2 is using Noise Protocol Framework, which makes it DPI resistant and results in a better performance at low-end devices (like smartphones and home routers). It is a big milestone for the I2P network development!

Normally, when most people first hear of so called Darknets or Overlay networks, they only think of TOR. And there is a good reason for that for its easy to use and very effective.

So, we should also not forget other less known darknet technologies.

Looking at the roadmap (https://geti2p.net/en/get-involved/roadmap) of i2p 0.9.23/0.9.24 there seems to be many Android improvements, including making the Android router service into a library. There has been some talk of an official mobile app in the works, are there any plans on integrating this new i2p library? Having i2p built into the app is much more user friendly and will lead to a much higher usage rate compared. Главная ссылка к новости (https://geti2p.net/en/blog/pos.)

This is something that's baffled me for a while. A large part of I2P (https://geti2p.net)'s security model is founded on the advantage of cover traffic, and the deniability that it provides. I think that's incredibly wise, and almost certainly makes timing and correlation attacks far, far more expensive. Yet I've seen in multiple places advice to avoid doing this with Tor. Why is that? The only thing I can think of is that DDoS'ing the node directly (since its IP address is public) could. Сайт программы: geti2p.net ОС: Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) или выше. ОЗУ: Минимум 512 МБ.
