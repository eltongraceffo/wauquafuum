In season 4, ep 12 "Verna", when the whole crew is watching Liz's surveillance tape from the night before, they see Frank with a lady from the workplace singing a lullaby to him, and Tracy yells out "This is the worst thing I've ever seen!". I'd love to have that as a gif to use for reactions. (Or just the clip to watch over and over because. Смотреть фильмы в hd онлайн. Чем себя занять после тяжелых трудовых будней?

Season 4, Episode 1: “Season 4” Director: Don Scardino Writers: Tina Fey Summary (from imdb): Liz and Pete are forced to search for new talent, but don't want the writers to know.

I knowww. Tina Fey already debunked the same universe theory, but I caught this nugget while rewatching 30 Rock: Season 6, episode 1, at about 2:50, Frank asks Kenneth what he did for the holidays and Kenneth states that "Reverend Gary did the math" and predicted the date of the end of the world. Seems like more than a coincidence. I was just watching 30 rock, Season 6, Episode 1. And kenneth just said "Reverend Gary did the math, and guess what? the world is ending tomorrow" I know Tina Fey said they are not in the universe, but still another connection between the two shows. Hi all, I'm trying to figure out what movie this is from -- I think it's the opening monologue (could also be an ending monologue), spoken by a man with a faintly Western voice. At the end of the monologue, the narrator goes something like "let me tell you a story about a guy named blank " or "this is the story about a man named blank " or something like that. After the narrator finishes speaking, the music swells (rising notes, played by horns maybe?) and then I think either the title. So, what does everyone think the best TV comedy of all time is? There's arguments for a lot of shows, and the title gets thrown around a lot. Personally, by top 5 are. 5 - The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret ( While it somet.
