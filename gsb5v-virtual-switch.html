I'm running into an issue with the Meraki Dashboard and Reporting for VM Guests on our Hyper-V Cluster. We have a converged network, so we're forced to use mac address client tracking but this isn't playing nice with Hyper-V's Virtual Switch. Basically, a few mac addresses are incorrectly showing up as other clients due to how the Hyper-V Virtual Switches do proxy-arp for all VM's behind them which is really throwing off our reporting. Everything on the network is working

VMware INFORMATION GUIDE An ESX Server virtual switch supports VLAN segmentation at the port level. This means each port can be configured in either. I am working on a esxi server that has pfsense on it. The server is a old optiplex 7010 with 32 gigs of ram, and 2 nic cards with 2 ports each and one onboard ethernet. I am using the onboard ethernet as a management port I am using 1 port on the nic for wan. I want to use the 3 remaining ports for 3 devices that go through the pfsense. I have set it up where one device works on one port. The first device gets a valid LAN ip address. When I add a second device through A virtual switch ( vsw ) is a component running in a service domain and managed by the virtual switch driver. A virtual switch can be connected to some guest domains. We've recently had a few servers decided to almost completely lock up when the Hyper V Virtual Switch is connected to the Internet with a Intel NIC. You have mouse movement, but no keyboard or mouse clicks. Unplug the guest network and it works fine. If you delete the virtual switch and have the network plugged in every things is fine, this seems completely tied to the hyper v guest network. We've tried updating drivers, disable RSS, disable offload, and a few other things that I have forgot. Cisco Virtual Networking brings advanced networking features, integrated services, and consistent operational model across physical and virtual environments.

Keep your system up to date for good measure, disable your wireless adapter and do not use that for virtual switch. 
I am testing my 10Gb networks performance across 2 blades. They have 2 10Gb NIC's in each server. Using Iperf3 on windows, if I run a speed test from NIC1 on blade 1 to NIC1 to blade 2 I get 10Gb+ Same from any NIC to any blade. If I put them in a team I still get the same performance (as expected as it binds to MAC) However if I create a vswitch and allow the host OS to share it, apply the IP to the vswitch and then test again my speeds drop from between 3Gb/s to 7Gb/s Has anyone Setting up one or more virtual switches.

One for docker and one for LXC. After creating a home assistant docker container I noticed that it shows in the overview as being hooked up to the LXC virtual switch at 10.0.3.x instead of the docker one at 10.0.5.x. Now. home assistant is still functional, but it confuses me and, if true, will probably mess something up down the line. Anyone with information regarding this strange behaviour? MX Series.
